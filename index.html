                Basketball is my Favourite things to do. Basketball is something I can do to clear my mind and just worry about basketball and nothing else. You use a ball to play basketball to score points or I say "buckets". You can score 3 points or 2 points or  1 point. You can get 3 points by making a bucket behind the 3 point line. To get 2 points you get a bucket inside the 3 point line. 1 point you can get from making a free throw.

        <div id="PS5" class="ew">
            <h2>PS5</h2>
            <p>
                The PS5 is a electroic device where you can play video games on. You can play with friends or by yoursef. Chatting with friends via headset or microphone is another thing you can do with a PS5. Thats why having a PS5 is such a great thing to have.

        <div id="NBA 2K24" class="ew">
            <h2>NBA 2K24</h2>
            <p>
                NBA 2K24 is a virtual basketball gaming experience. This game is personally my Favourite to  play at the moment. You can experience the real life thrill of the sport basketball at home on your coach and control your favourite ballers right in front of you.
